Static site generators are a very efficient way to produce content for the web.

I particularly find it very convenient to write posts in [simple Markdown text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

The blog is pre-rendered using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/), according to principles collectively known as [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/what-is-jamstack/)

> Jamstack is an architecture designed to make the web faster, more secure, and easier to scale. It builds on many of the tools and workflows which developers love, and which bring maximum productivity.
