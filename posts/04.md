# Jamstack workflow

I'm still getting used to  Eleventy's + Bitbucket + Netlify workflow.

Every push to the master branch in BitBucket generates a build process in Netlify, as in [post-receive web hook](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/using-repository-hooks-776639836.html).

    {% image "./img/2021-12-24-210146.png", "continuous integration", "(min-width: 100em)" %}
</a>

Build consists of running eleventy in a container, which generating static content that gets uploaded to Netlify's CDN (similar to AWS S3).

Netlify DNS is configured to link the bucket to my own domain.


## Eleventy

Now exploring:
- [Eleventy Navigation](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/navigation/)
- [Eleventy Image Plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/)
- [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/)

I set up Eleventy Navigation for dynamic generation of links:

<a href="/img/2021-12-24-194215.png" target="_blank">
    {% image "./img/2021-12-24-194215.png", "intermediate results", "(min-width: 100em)" %}
</a>

Eleventy's Image plugin displays screenshots:

<a href="/img/2021-12-24-201230.png" target="_blank">
    {% image "./img/2021-12-24-201230.png", "display screenshot with plugin", "(min-width: 100em)" %}
</a>

During pre-rendering, images referenced by the **image** macro are automagically converted to JPEG, and re-linked.

<a href="/img/2021-12-24-204217.png" target="_blank">
    {% image "./img/2021-12-24-204217.png", "display screenshot with plugin", "(min-width: 100em)" %}
</a>

The original PNG is the larger version of the screenshot.

## wrapping up

That's enough for today, here are some accomplishments:

- basic understanding of how Eleventy works
- can create posts with simple markdown
- can add screenshots to posts by using the appropriate plugin
- deployed the blog to a real domain hosted by Netlify
- continuous integration with BitBucket (push-to-publish)

Things to watch for in the next Eleventy study session:

- Nunjuck's [import tag](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html#import)
- Eleventy [shortCodes](https://v0-7-1.11ty.dev/docs/shortcodes/)

And have a closer look at [Words to avoid in educational writing](https://css-tricks.com/words-avoid-educational-writing/)

And learn how to use the [eleventy-plugin-bibtex plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eleventy-plugin-bibtex)

Merry Xmas
