# Eleventy is ditched

After a few days, I decided to ditch [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) in favor of [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/).

I still can understand why someone would choose Eleventy.  It is pretty simple to configure and extend.

But VuePress has better plugins, and it gives me access to all the [awesome stuff from Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue).

Source code for the current iteration will be forked and shared at github.
